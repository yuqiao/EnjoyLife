## 1.1 Why Clojure?


Simple, powerful.


## 1.2 Quick Start

# 2. Exploring Clojure

## 2.1 Forms

Clojure is homoiconic, which is say that Clojure code is composed of Clojure data.

### Using Numeric Types
Numeric literals are forms.

A vector of numebers is form.

A list is "just data," but it is also used to call function.

Form:
- Boolean
- Character
- Keyword
- List
- Map
- Nil
- Number
- Set 
- String
- Symbol
- Vector

### Symbols
Forms such as +, concat, and java.lang.String are called symbols and are used to name things.

+ names the function that adds things together.

Symbols name all sorts of thins in Clojure:
- Functions like str and concat.
- "Operators" like + and -, which are , after all, just functions.
- Java classes like java.lang.String and java.util.Random.
- Namespaces like clojure.core and java packages like java.lang
- Data sturctures and refereces

### Strings and Characters

### Booleans and Nil

Clojure's rules for booleans:
- true is true, and false is false.
- in addition to false, nil also eveluates to false when used in boolean context.
- other than false and nil, everythin else evaluates to true in boolean context.

() and 0 are both true.
